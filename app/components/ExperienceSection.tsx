            , where I focused on the backend of a mobile application that helps parents engage with their children through educational activities, lessons, and affirmations. Throughout the internship, I built scalable microservices using TypeScript and AWS, designed APIs that connected backend services with the mobile app, and collaborated closely with a team of engineers to deliver new features and improve system reliability. Working on a product used by real families gave me valuable experience building production-level software and taught me the importance of designing systems that are both reliable and scalable.

              Hi, I'm Hannah Lee, a current undergraduate at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science and minoring in Psychology! Since elementary school, I've always found myself drawn to math and the way numbers logically piece together with a single solution. Naturally, I picked up Computer Science in my junior year of high school after taking AP Computer Science A, and I decided to pursue a career in the field of software engineering.
